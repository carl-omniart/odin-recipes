            <p>
              A silky mousse contrasts nicely to crumbly baked items. In-season fresh raspberries give this mousse a refreshing sharpness. Plus, if you are so inclined, there's opportunity for creativity in how you serve the mousse. Wine glasses work, but we were delighted to use some cute small jars that we had saved.

              <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
              <li>1&frac12; teaspoons unflavored gelatin</li>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <div>
            <ol class="text">
              <li>
                Take 2 cups of raspberries (reserving the other &frac12; cup for garnishing), wash them, and puree them in a food processor until smooth. Using a mesh collander and wooden spatula (or similar tool), strain as much liquid as possible from the puree, then discard the seeds.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a large bowl, mix together strained raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over cold water, and let it stand for one minute. Gently heat the saucepan and stir until gelatin has completely dissolved.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add the gelatin mixture to the raspberry mixture. Combine everything thoroughly. Chill the mousse in the fridge until it is slightly thickened, about one hour.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Using a hand mixer on high speed, beat the mousse until it becomes foamy. Gradually pour in the heavy whipping cream, continuing to beat until thick and fluffy, about two minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spoon the mousse into individual dessert dishes and cover them. Refrigerate until the mousse sets, about 1-2 hours. Garnish with the remaining fresh raspberries.
              </li>
            </ol>
